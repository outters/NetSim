For the Network::random_connect method, as the teacher said two implementations were possible.
I submitted the one that passed the tests but I added my first version as a comment at the end of the network.cpp.
This version did not pass the tests as it would first determine the number of total links that each node should have in the end 
with a Poisson distribution and thus would take into account the links already made before making new links.

For the Network::resize method, it was not asked to also delete the links corresponding to the values beign deleted.
